Overview
--------

The Quiz module is based off of the specification created by Robert Douglass:
http://www.webs4.com/quiz_module.

The module consists of two types of modules: the Quiz module itself 
(quiz.module), and various question types (example: multichoice.module). The 
main Quiz module and at least one question type module are required to be both
installed and enabled for this module to function properly.


Installation
------------

1. Copy this directory to the Drupal modules/ directory.

2. Log in to your site as an administrator, and go to the administer >> modules
   section. Enable both the quiz module and at least one question type module 
   (for example, multichoice).

3. Execute the commands in the quiz.mysql file, using a command such as:
     mysql -hhostname -uusername -p databasename < quiz.mysql 

4. Create a vocabulary (or several) for classifying quiz questions, and 
   associate one or more question types with that vocabulary. These steps are 
   performed in administer >> categories.

5. Create a user role with "create quiz" and "administer <question_type>"
   permissions. This can be setup under administer >> access control >> roles.
   Assigning users to this role allows users other than the administrator to 
   create questions and quizzes.


How to create a quiz
--------------------

1. Begin by creating a series of questions that you would like to include in 
   the quiz. Go to create content >> <question type> (for example, multichoice).
   
2. Next, create a basic quiz by going to create content >> quiz. You will have 
   the opportunity to set numerous options such as the number of questions, 
   whether or not to shuffle question order, etc. When finished, click "Submit."
   
3. Finally, add questions to the quiz by clicking the "Add questions" tab. First,
   adjust the search criteria and click "Search" to bring up a list of matching
   questions. Once the list is created, select the options on how you want each 
   question to appear in the quiz. Finally, click "Submit" to complete the quiz 
   creation.
