NOTES ON DEVELOPING EXTENSIONS FOR QUIZ
=======================================

DEVELOPING NEW QUESTION TYPES:

You need to create a new module that extends the existing 
question type core. The multichoice question type provides a precise example.

Here are the steps:

1. Create a new module
2. Use your module's .install file to create the necessary tables
3. Implements hook_quiz_question_info()
4. Define classes that extends Drupal\quiz_question\QuestionHandler and Drupal\quiz_question\ResponseHandler.
